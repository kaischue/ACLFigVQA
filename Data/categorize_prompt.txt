### Refined Task Instructions:

1. Assign each question to one of the following categories based on the given definitions
2. Provide a short form Answer for every question

### Categories:

1. **Simple Retrieval**:
   - **Focus**: Directly locating and extracting a single value or label from the chart based on its position or color. No calculations or comparisons are involved.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Relies on visual cues such as position or color.
     - Does not require any calculations.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the topmost bar in the chart?"
     - Color: "What is the value of the green bar?"

2. **Simple Calculation**:
   - **Focus**: Performing one arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, ratio, or a simple comparison like "greater than") on one or two data points identified by their position or color.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Involves a single arithmetic operation.
     - Uses one or two data points for calculation.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the difference between the heights of the first and last bars?"
     - Color: "What is the sum of the values of the blue and red bars?"

3. **Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning**:
   - **Focus**: Performing multiple arithmetic operations or more involved calculations (like average, median, sum of a range) on data points identified by position or color. It includes logical reasoning to determine which calculations to perform or making intricate comparisons, decisions, or inferences.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Involves multiple arithmetic operations or steps.
     - Requires additional logical steps, intermediate calculations, or comparisons.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the average height of all bars except the first and last?"
     - Color: "What is the average value of all blue bars?"
     - Positional: "Which two bars together have a height that sums to 10?"
     - Color: "Is the sum of the heights of the blue bars greater than the average height of the green bars?"

4. **Caption Question**
   - **Focus**: The question can be answered using the figure and the caption only. The relevant paper section is not needed for this question.
   Depending on the complexity of the question, this must be combined with categories 1-3.
   These categories exist:
   Caption Question/Simple Retrival
   Caption Question/Simple Calculation
   Caption Question/Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning
   - **Criteria**:
     - Can be of any complexity, but needs to be combined with categories 1-3.
     - Needs to be answerable from the caption (and figure)
     - If the question can be answered with the image alone, classify it as the categories 1-3 only

5. **Requires Paper Context**:
   - **Focus**: These questions require background information or context from the relevant paper.
   This always involves consulting the provided research paper in the metadata string.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Can only be answered with information from the research paper ({relevant_pdf_str}).
     - Cannot be answered using just the figure and its caption!!!!.
     - The Image caption does not count as additional context!!!
     - Requires the reader to have read and understood the paper to integrate additional data or context to derive the answer.
   - **Instructions**:
     - Verify that the question indeed requires context from the paper ({relevant_pdf_str}).
     - If the question can be answered form the caption alone, it does not meet the criteria of "Questions Requiring Additional Context from the research paper". Classify it as another category then.
     - Provide the necessary section (or part of a section) from the paper as full text required to answer the question. Add this section as an additional column "context".

### Short form Answer
- For each question, provide an additional short-form answer.
- The short answer should be as concise as possible. Ideally, one word or a numerical value (e.g., Yes, No, a number, Smaller, Larger).
- The short answer must still make sense as a standalone response to the question.
- For questions requiring additional context, shorten the answer if feasible; if not, use the full answer.
- The short-form answer should match the corrected answer in meaning (just shorter).
- Present the answers in two columns: 'short_answer_english' and 'short_answer_german'.

Example:

| question                                 | long_answer                            | short_answer_english | short_answer_german |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Is the sky blue?                         | Yes, the sky is blue.                  | Yes                  | Ja                  |
| How much is 2 plus 2?                    | The result of 2 plus 2 is 4.           | 4                    | 4                   |
| What is the capital of France?           | The capital of France is Paris.        | Paris                | Paris               |
| Can you explain photosynthesis in brief? | Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. | Photosynthesis: plant energy conversion from sunlight. | Photosynthese: Umwandlung von Sonnenlicht in Energie. |


### Metadata String:
You will receive the image, generated question-answer pairs, metadata string which includes a relevant paper section ({relevant_pdf_str}). The metadata string is structured as follows:

- Here is some additional info for the image:
  - The label of the image is: {label}.
  - The caption of the image is: {caption}.
  - The inline reference of the image is: {inline_reference}.
  - And the relevant section from the research paper that includes the figure caption.
  - This section starts from {self.figure_mention_range} characters before and after the first mention of the figure caption:
  - {relevant_pdf_str}

You will find the metadata at the end of this message.
