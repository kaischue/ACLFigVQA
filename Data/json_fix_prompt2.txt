Can you please fix this JSON?. Only reply with the fixed JSON string, nothing else!
So that I can directly parse it!

Make sure the json has the following format:

AnswerPair = {
    "question_english": str,
    "question_german": str,
    "chain_of_thought": str,
    "chain_of_thought2": str,
    "answer_english": str,
    "answer_german": str,
    "confidence_explanation": str,
    "confidence": str
}
Return: [AnswerPair1, AnswerPair2, ...]

ONLY reply with the JSON, nothing else! No additional text, just the JSON! Ensure the response is a valid JSON object!
The JSON string must be parsable directly form your response with no adjustment required. This is extremely important.
Ensure each object in the JSON array includes all required fields exactly as listed above.
This is the code that is used to read the json_response to a dataclass:
json_response = json.loads(response.text)
qa_objects = [QAPairGenConf(**qa) for qa in json_response]
where QAPairGenConf is:
@dataclass
class QAPairGenConf:
    question_german: str
    question_english: str
    answer_english: str
    answer_german: str
    chain_of_thought: str
    chain_of_thought2: str
    confidence_explanation: str
    confidence: str

If you notice that a field is missing in an object, please add the missing field to the object without removing any other fields.
Also, the field need to be in exactly the order as defined above.
Only respond with the JSON array, nothing else.
If you don't follow this the whole system could crash and a lot of data will be lost, resulting in millions of damage.
