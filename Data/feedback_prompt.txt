### Metadata String:
You will receive the image, the generated QA-Pairs, the templates, and metadata string which includes a relevant paper section ({relevant_pdf_str}). The metadata string is structured as follows:

- Here is some additional info for the image:
  - The label of the image is: {label}.
  - The caption of the image is: {caption}.
  - The inline reference of the image is: {inline_reference}.
  - And the relevant section from the research paper that includes the figure caption.
  - This section starts from {self.figure_mention_range} characters before and after the first mention of the figure caption:
  - {relevant_pdf_str}

You will find the metadata at the end of this message.

### Categories:

1. **Simple Retrieval**:
   - **Focus**: Directly locating and extracting a single value or label from the chart based on its position or color. No calculations or comparisons are involved.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Relies on visual cues such as position or color.
     - Does not require any calculations.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the topmost bar in the chart?"
     - Color: "What is the value of the green bar?"

2. **Simple Calculation (1-Step)**:
   - **Focus**: Performing one arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, ratio, or a simple comparison like "greater than") on one or two data points identified by their position or color.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Involves a single arithmetic operation.
     - Uses one or two data points for calculation.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the difference between the heights of the first and last bars?"
     - Color: "What is the sum of the values of the blue and red bars?"

3. **Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning**:
   - **Focus**: Performing multiple arithmetic operations or more involved calculations (like average, median, sum of a range) on data points identified by position or color. It includes logical reasoning to determine which calculations to perform or making intricate comparisons, decisions, or inferences.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Involves multiple arithmetic operations or steps.
     - Requires additional logical steps, intermediate calculations, or comparisons.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the average height of all bars except the first and last?"
     - Color: "What is the average value of all blue bars?"
     - Positional: "Which two bars together have a height that sums to 10?"
     - Color: "Is the sum of the heights of the blue bars greater than the average height of the green bars?"

4. **Additional Context Question**:
   - **Focus**: These questions require background information or context from the relevant paper or the provided reference to answer. This always involves consulting the provided research paper ({relevant_pdf_str}), the provided reference ({inline_reference}), and the associated diagram.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Can only be answered with information from the research paper ({relevant_pdf_str}) or the inline reference ({inline_reference}).
     - Cannot be answered using just the figure or its caption.
     - Requires the reader to have read and understood the paper to integrate additional data or context to derive the answer.
     - The image is also needed to answer the question. It is about analyzing and questioning the image based on additional context, identifying trends, and finding explanations.
     - All information must come exclusively from the paper or the diagram. Own considerations or information from other sources are not permitted, though interpretations based on the available data are allowed.
   - **Example Methods**:
     - Trend Analysis: Identify rising, falling, or stable trends in the data from the paper.
     - Root Cause Analysis: Consider what external or internal factors from the paper might be causing the observed trends.
     - Comparison with Historical Data: Compare the current data from the paper with historical data to recognize changes over time.
     - Future Predictions: Use current trends from the paper to make predictions about future developments.
     - Anomaly Detection: Look for unusual or unexpected values from the paper that deviate from general trends.
     - Hypothesis Formation: Formulate hypotheses about why certain trends from the paper occur, and consider how you might test them.

### Evaluate the following criteria for the generated questions:

1. **Visual Attributes**: Are the questions genuinely visual, requiring examination of the image's visual attributes (e.g., color, position, orientation)?
2. **Category Coverage**: Are there five questions, each from these categories: "Simple Retrieval", "Simple Calculation", "Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning"(2) and "Additional Context Question"?
3. **Relevance and Fit**: Do the questions appropriately fit the figure and relate to the visual elements present?
4. **Clarity and Unambiguity**: Are the questions clear and unambiguous, allowing for only one correct answer?
5. **Answer-ability**: Can the questions be answered accurately using the image and metadata? Criticize questions that cannot.
6. **Complexity Appropriateness**: Do the questions match the intended complexity level (simple, one-step, complex, reasoning)?
7. **Language Precision**: Are the questions clear, grammatically correct, and free of errors?
8. **Variety**: Is there a variety of question types and difficulty levels to address different analytical skills? (grade at the end for all questions)

### Questions Requiring Additional Context:

0. Also grade the Question based on same criteria for the non context questions
0. **Visual Attributes**: Ensure this question necessitates referencing the image alongside the text. If it can be answered by the text alone, it fails to meet the standards and should be heavily criticized.
1. **Contextual Necessity**: Evaluate how effectively the question incorporates additional context from the paper.
2. **Dependency**: Confirm that the question requires the research paper's context for an answer. If the question can be answered solely from the caption, it should be heavily criticized. Additionally, ensure the context is not already provided within the question itself; reading the research paper must always be essential.
3. **Complexity**: Determine if the added context enhances the question's complexity and depth.
4. **Creativity**: Assess the originality and creativity of the questions. It should involve analyzing and questioning the image with additional context, identifying trends, and discovering explanations or similar methods.

### Feedback on Answers:

1. **Accuracy**: Are the answers correct and match the figure's information?
2. **Clarity**: Are the answers clearly stated and easy to understand?
3. **Completeness**: Do the answers provide all necessary information required by the questions?
4. **Conciseness**: Are the answers concise and to the point?
5. **Confidence Level**: Indicate your confidence in the correctness of the provided answers.

### Final Evaluation:

For each question-answer pair, provide the grading and an explanation based on the above criteria. Clearly state the strengths and areas for improvement for each pair.
For the question with additional context make sure the question actually requires context from the paper, give the section (or part of a section) as full text from the paper that is necessary to answer the question!
The caption doesn't count as additional context! This ensures that one actually has to read parts of the paper to answer this type of question.
If the additional context question falls fails the criteria, provide ideas for a different question or how this question can be improved to pass the criteria.
