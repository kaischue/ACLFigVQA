You will get the image, the templates and the generated question answer pairs as well as the metadata string and the relevant section of the paper.
Evaluate the following criteria for the generated questions:

1. **Visual Attributes**: Determine if the questions are genuinely visual questions, requiring examination of the visual attributes of the image, such as color, position, or orientation.
2. **Category Coverage**: Confirm that there are five questions, each from the specified categories: "Simple_Retrieval," "Simple_Calculation_1-Step," "Complex_Calculation_Multi-Step," "Logical_Reasoning," and one that requires additional context from the paper.
3. **Relevance and Fit**: Assess whether the questions fit the provided figure appropriately and are relevant to the visual elements present.
4. **Clarity and Unambiguity**: Evaluate whether the questions can be answered clearly in one way, avoiding ambiguous questions with multiple possible answers.
5. **Answer-ability**: Ensure the question can be answered from the image and metadata. Also make sure the question can be answered accurately. Heavily criticize questions that cant be answered from the material.
6. **Complexity Appropriateness**: Ensure that the questions maintain the intended complexity level—simple, one-step calculations, multi-step calculations, logical reasoning, etc.
7. **Language Precision**: Check for clarity, grammar, and phrasing. Are the questions clearly worded and free of errors?
8. **Variety**: Ensure there is a variety of question types and difficulty levels to cater to different analytical skills.

Here are the definitions of the different categories:

Simple Retrieval:
Directly locating and extracting a single value or label from the chart based on its position or color. No calculations or comparisons are involved.
Focus: Locating information based on visual cues.
Example (Positional): "What is the Topmost bar?", "What is the Leftmost data point in the third group?"
Example (Color): "What is the value of the green bar?" "Which legend item is represented by blue?"

Simple Calculation (1-Step):
Performing one arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, ratio, or a simple comparison like "greater than") on one or two data points identified by their position or color.
Focus: A single, direct calculation.
Example (Positional): "What is the difference between the first and last bar?" "What is the ratio of the two leftmost bars?"
Example (Color): "What is the sum of values of the blue and red bars?" "Is the green bar larger than the orange bar?"

Complex Calculation (Multi-Step):
Performing multiple arithmetic operations or more involved calculations (like average, median, sum of a range) on data points identified by position or color. The logic is usually straightforward – it's about the calculations themselves.
Focus: Performing a series of calculations.
Example (Positional): "What is the average of all bars except the first and last?" "What is the sum of the top three values?"
Example (Color): "What is the average value of all blue bars?" "What is the sum of the squares of the red bar values?"

Logical Reasoning (Positional/Color):
Definition: Questions that require determining which calculations to perform or involve more intricate comparisons, decisions, or inferences. The calculations might be simple, but the emphasis is on problem-solving and strategy. It often involves finding relationships between data points.
Focus: Deciding what steps to take, making comparisons, or drawing conclusions.
Example (Positional): "Which two bars have a combined value 10?", "Which section of the chart has the greatest increase in value?"
Example (Color): "Is the blue bars' sum greater than the green bars' average?", "Which color represents the smallest overall contribution?"

For questions requiring additional context:

1. **Contextual Necessity**: Evaluate how well the question integrates additional context from the paper, caption, or inline reference.
2. **Dependency**: Confirm that the question can’t be answered without referencing the additional context provided.
3. **Complexity**: Ensure that the added context increases the complexity and depth of the question.
4. **Creativity**: Assess the originality and creativity of the questions. Do they bring a unique perspective or challenge?

Additionally, provide feedback on the answers based on the following criteria:

1. **Accuracy**: Verify that the provided answers are correct and match the information present in the figure.
2. **Clarity**: Ensure the answers are clearly stated and easy to understand.
3. **Completeness**: Confirm that the answers provide all necessary information required by the questions.
4. **Conciseness**: Check that the answers are concise and to the point, without unnecessary elaboration.
5. **Confidence Level**: Indicate how confident you are in the correctness of the answers provided, compare to your own answers.
