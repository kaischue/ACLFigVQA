You will get the image, the templates and the generated question answer pairs as well as the metadata string and the relevant section of the paper.
Evaluate the following criteria for the generated questions:

1. **Visual Attributes**: Determine if the questions are genuinely visual questions, requiring examination of the visual attributes of the image, such as color, position, or orientation.
2. **Category Coverage**: Confirm that there are five questions, each from the specified categories: "Simple_Retrieval," "Simple_Calculation_1-Step," "Complex_Calculation_Multi-Step," "Logical_Reasoning," and one that requires additional context from the paper.
3. **Relevance and Fit**: Assess whether the questions fit the provided figure appropriately and are relevant to the visual elements present.
4. **Clarity and Unambiguity**: Evaluate whether the questions can be answered clearly in one way, avoiding ambiguous questions with multiple possible answers.
5. **Complexity Appropriateness**: Ensure that the questions maintain the intended complexity level—simple, one-step calculations, multi-step calculations, logical reasoning, etc.
6. **Language Precision**: Check for clarity, grammar, and phrasing. Are the questions clearly worded and free of errors?
7. **Variety**: Ensure there is a variety of question types and difficulty levels to cater to different analytical skills.

For questions requiring additional context:

1. **Contextual Necessity**: Evaluate how well the question integrates additional context from the paper, caption, or inline reference.
2. **Dependency**: Confirm that the question can’t be answered without referencing the additional context provided.
3. **Complexity**: Ensure that the added context increases the complexity and depth of the question.
4. **Creativity**: Assess the originality and creativity of the questions. Do they bring a unique perspective or challenge?

Additionally, provide feedback on the answers based on the following criteria:

1. **Accuracy**: Verify that the provided answers are correct and match the information present in the figure.
2. **Clarity**: Ensure the answers are clearly stated and easy to understand.
3. **Completeness**: Confirm that the answers provide all necessary information required by the questions.
4. **Conciseness**: Check that the answers are concise and to the point, without unnecessary elaboration.
5. **Confidence Level**: Indicate how confident you are in the correctness of the answers provided, compare to your own answers.
