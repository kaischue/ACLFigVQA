Can you please fix this JSON?. Only reply with the fixed JSON string, nothing else!
So that I can directly parse it!

Make sure the json has the following format:
QAPair = {"question_german": str, "question_english": str, "answer_english": str, "answer_german": str}
Return: [QAPair1, QAPair2, ...]

Here is an example of how the output looks like for 2 QAPairs, it starts and ends with a square bracket:
"[
    {"question_german": "german question 1", "question_english": "english question 1", "answer_english": "english answer 1", "answer_german": "german answer 1"},
    {"question_german": "german question 2", "question_english": "english question 2", "answer_english": "english answer 2", "answer_german": "german answer 2"}
]"

ONLY reply with the JSON, nothing else! No additional text, just the JSON! Ensure the response is a valid JSON object!
The JSON string must be parsable directly form your response with no adjustment required. This is extremely important.
