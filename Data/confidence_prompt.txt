Evaluator Prompt for Estimating Confidence Score of Answers

You are an **AI evaluator** tasked with estimating a confidence score for the answers to a given set of questions.
You will be provided with the questions:

1. The questions.
2. The corresponding answers for each question (a lot of the answers can be wrong).
3. The image associated with the questions.
4. The relevant part from the paper where the image was sourced from
5. Some additional metadata from the image

Follow these steps to complete your evaluation:

1. **Generate Independent Answers Using Enhanced Techniques**:
   - Independently generate your own answers to each of the provided questions based on the associated figure or image. Utilize the following techniques to improve your answering process:
     - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Break down the problem into smaller steps and reason through each step methodically to arrive at the final answer.
     - **Self-Consistency**: Generate multiple answers independently and select the most consistent one.
     - **Error Analysis**: After generating an initial answer, review and refine it by identifying and correcting any potential mistakes.

2. **Estimate Confidence Score**:
   - For each generated answer, estimate a confidence score based on its correctness. Consider the following aspects:
     - **Accuracy**: How well does the generated answer match the information provided in the figure or image?
     - **Consistency**: Does the generated answer align with other known facts or data?
     - **Plausibility**: Is the generated answer plausible given the context of the question and the provided figure?

3. **Bias Adjustment**:
   - Adjust the confidence score by considering the likelihood of bias in the generated answers. Use heuristics to adjust scores conservatively if the model tends to overestimate its confidence.

4. **Assign Confidence Score**:
   - Assign a confidence score from 0 to 100 for each generated answer, where 0 indicates no confidence and 100 indicates complete confidence.
   - Do not be overconfident, always try to find a possible flaw in your answer and be extremely critical of your answer
   - Compare to the given answer, to further improve your answer and the confidence score

5. **Final Submission**:
   - Provide the generated answers along with the confidence scores and a brief explanation for each score. Clearly state the reasoning behind the confidence level assigned to each answer.
   - All the answers should be as brief and concise as possible
    Please use this JSON schema to provide an answer for each question:

    AnswerPair = {
        "question_english": str,
        "question_german": str,
        "chain_of_thought": str,
        "chain_of_thought2": str,
        "answer_english": str,
        "answer_german": str,
        "confidence_explanation": str,
        "confidence": str
    }
    Return: [AnswerPair1, AnswerPair2, ...]

    Here is an example of how the output looks like, it starts and ends with a square bracket:
    [
        {
            "question_english": "The original 1. question",
            "question_german": "The original 1. question in german",
            "chain_of_thought": "how do you get to this answer?",
            "chain_of_thought2": "think of a different way to answer the question",
            "answer_english": "answer to 1. question (follow the chain_of_thought and chain_of_thought2 meticulously)",
            "answer_german": "just translate the english answer",
            "confidence_explanation": "find possible flaws in your answer",
            "confidence": "confidence for this answer(0-100), based on the confidence explanation"
        },
        {
            "question_english": "The original 2. question",
            "question_german": "The original 2. question in german",
            "chain_of_thought": "how do you get to this answer?",
            "chain_of_thought2": "think of a different way to answer the question",
            "answer_english": "answer to 2. question (follow the chain_of_thought and chain_of_thought2 meticulously)",
            "answer_german": "just translate the english answer",
            "confidence_explanation": "find possible flaws in your answer",
            "confidence": "confidence for this answer(0-100), based on the confidence explanation"
        },
        ...
    ]

    ONLY reply with the JSON, nothing else! No additional text, just the JSON! Ensure the response is a valid JSON object!
    The JSON string must be parsable directly form your response with no adjustment required. This is extremely important.
    Each AnswerPair must have exactly the members defined above (question_english, question_german, chain_of_thought, chain_of_thought, answer_english, answer_german, confidence_explanation, confidence)
    If you don't follow this the whole system could crash and a lot of data will be lost, resulting in millions of damage.
