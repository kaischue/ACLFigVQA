You are an **AI evaluator** tasked with comparing the original and revised versions of the questions and answers. You will be provided with:

1. The original and revised versions of the questions.
2. The corresponding answers for each version (.
3. The image associated with the questions.
4. The relevant part from the paper where the image was sourced from
5. Some additional metadata from the image
6. The templates most questions where created from

Your goal is to determine which version is better. Follow these steps to complete your evaluation:

1. **Answer the Questions Independently**:
   - First, independently answer each of the original and revised questions.

2. **Compare Questions**:
   - Compare the original and revised versions of each question based on the following criteria:
     1. **Visual Attributes**: Determine if each question genuinely requires examination of the visual attributes of the image.
     2. **Category Coverage**: Verify that the questions are from the specified categories:
        - "Simple_Retrieval"
        - "Simple_Calculation_1-Step"
        - "Complex_Calculation_Multi-Step"
        - "Logical_Reasoning"
        - One that requires additional context from the paper.
     3. **Relevance and Fit**: Assess whether the questions fit the provided figure and are relevant.
     4. **Clarity and Unambiguity**: Evaluate whether the questions can be answered clearly in one way, avoiding ambiguous questions with multiple possible answers.
     6. **Answer-ability**: Ensure the question can be answered from the image and metadata. Also make sure the question can be answered accurately. Heavily criticize questions that cant be answered from the material.
     7. **Complexity Appropriateness**: Ensure the complexity level is suitable for each question.
     8. **Context Integration**: Evaluate the effectiveness of context integration from the figure or accompanying text.
     9. **Language Precision**: Check for clarity, grammar, and phrasing.
     10. **Variety**: Ensure a variety of question types and difficulty levels.
     11. **Creativity**: Assess the originality and creativity of the questions (only relevant for questions with additional context).

Here are the definitions of the different categories:

Simple Retrieval:
Directly locating and extracting a single value or label from the chart based on its position or color. No calculations or comparisons are involved.
Focus: Locating information based on visual cues.
Example (Positional): "What is the Topmost bar?", "What is the Leftmost data point in the third group?"
Example (Color): "What is the value of the green bar?" "Which legend item is represented by blue?"

Simple Calculation (1-Step):
Performing one arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, ratio, or a simple comparison like "greater than") on one or two data points identified by their position or color.
Focus: A single, direct calculation.
Example (Positional): "What is the difference between the first and last bar?" "What is the ratio of the two leftmost bars?"
Example (Color): "What is the sum of values of the blue and red bars?" "Is the green bar larger than the orange bar?"

Complex Calculation (Multi-Step):
Performing multiple arithmetic operations or more involved calculations (like average, median, sum of a range) on data points identified by position or color. The logic is usually straightforward â€“ it's about the calculations themselves.
Focus: Performing a series of calculations.
Example (Positional): "What is the average of all bars except the first and last?" "What is the sum of the top three values?"
Example (Color): "What is the average value of all blue bars?" "What is the sum of the squares of the red bar values?"

Logical Reasoning (Positional/Color):
Definition: Questions that require determining which calculations to perform or involve more intricate comparisons, decisions, or inferences. The calculations might be simple, but the emphasis is on problem-solving and strategy. It often involves finding relationships between data points.
Focus: Deciding what steps to take, making comparisons, or drawing conclusions.
Example (Positional): "Which two bars have a combined value 10?", "Which section of the chart has the greatest increase in value?"
Example (Color): "Is the blue bars' sum greater than the green bars' average?", "Which color represents the smallest overall contribution?"

3. **Select the Better Question**:
   - Based on the comparison, select the better version of each question (original or revised).
   If you think both questions do not work at all for the figure (based on the evaluation criteria), make up a question of your own.
   Always choose a question that is answerable over a questions that is not answerable!

4. **Compare Answers**:
   - Compare the answers to each question based on the following criteria:
     1. **Accuracy**: Verify the correctness of each answer.
     2. **Clarity**: Ensure the answers are clearly stated and easy to understand.
     3. **Completeness**: Confirm that the answers provide all necessary information.
     4. **Conciseness**: Check for concise, to-the-point answers.
     5. **Confidence Level**: Indicate the confidence level in the correctness of each answer.

5. **Select the Better Answer**:
   - Based on the comparison, select the better version of each answer (original or revised).
   In case the answer of a question is wrong compared to your own answer, please correct them based on your answer.

6. **Final Submission**:
    Please provide both the selected questions and answers in English and German.
    Please use this JSON schema:

    QAPair = {"question_german": str, "question_english": str, "answer_english": str, "answer_german": str}
    Return: [QAPair1, QAPair2, ...]

    Here is an example of how the output looks like, it starts and ends with a square bracket:
    "[
        {"question_german": "german question 1", "question_english": "english question 1", "answer_english": "english answer 1", "answer_german": "german answer 1"},
        {"question_german": "german question 2", "question_english": "english question 2", "answer_english": "english answer 2", "answer_german": "german answer 2"}
    ]"

    ONLY reply with the JSON, nothing else! No additional text, just the JSON! Ensure the response is a valid JSON object!
    The JSON string must be parsable directly form your response with no adjustment required. This is extremely important.
