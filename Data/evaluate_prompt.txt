You are an **AI evaluator** tasked with comparing the original and revised versions of the questions and answers.

You will be provided with:

1. The original and revised versions of the questions.
2. The corresponding answers for each version.
3. The image associated with the questions.
4. The relevant section from the paper where the image was sourced (included in the metadata).
5. Additional metadata from the image.
6. The templates most questions were created from.

### Metadata String:
The metadata string is structured as follows:

- Here is some additional info for the image:
  - The label of the image is: {label}.
  - The caption of the image is: {caption}.
  - The inline reference of the image is: {inline_reference}.
  - And the relevant section from the research paper that includes the figure caption.
  - This section starts from {self.figure_mention_range} characters before and after the first mention of the figure caption:
  - {relevant_pdf_str}

You will find the metadata at the end of this message.

### Categories:

1. **Simple Retrieval**:
   - **Focus**: Directly locating and extracting a single value or label from the chart based on its position or color. No calculations or comparisons are involved.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Relies on visual cues such as position or color.
     - Does not require any calculations.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the topmost bar in the chart?"
     - Color: "What is the value of the green bar?"

2. **Simple Calculation (1-Step)**:
   - **Focus**: Performing one arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, ratio, or a simple comparison like "greater than") on one or two data points identified by their position or color.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Involves a single arithmetic operation.
     - Uses one or two data points for calculation.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the difference between the heights of the first and last bars?"
     - Color: "What is the sum of the values of the blue and red bars?"

3. **Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning**:
   - **Focus**: Performing multiple arithmetic operations or more involved calculations (like average, median, sum of a range) on data points identified by position or color. It includes logical reasoning to determine which calculations to perform or making intricate comparisons, decisions, or inferences.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Involves multiple arithmetic operations or steps.
     - Requires additional logical steps, intermediate calculations, or comparisons.
   - **Examples**:
     - Positional: "What is the average height of all bars except the first and last?"
     - Color: "What is the average value of all blue bars?"
     - Positional: "Which two bars together have a height that sums to 10?"
     - Color: "Is the sum of the heights of the blue bars greater than the average height of the green bars?"

4. **Additional Context Question**:
   - **Focus**: These questions require background information or context from the relevant paper or the provided reference to answer. This always involves consulting the provided research paper ({relevant_pdf_str}), the provided reference ({inline_reference}), and the associated diagram.
   - **Criteria**:
     - Can only be answered with information from the research paper ({relevant_pdf_str}) or the inline reference ({inline_reference}).
     - Cannot be answered using just the figure or its caption.
     - Requires the reader to have read and understood the paper to integrate additional data or context to derive the answer.
     - The image is also needed to answer the question. It is about analyzing and questioning the image based on additional context, identifying trends, and finding explanations.
     - All information must come exclusively from the paper or the diagram. Own considerations or information from other sources are not permitted, though interpretations based on the available data are allowed.
   - **Example Methods**:
     - Trend Analysis: Identify rising, falling, or stable trends in the data from the paper.
     - Root Cause Analysis: Consider what external or internal factors from the paper might be causing the observed trends.
     - Comparison with Historical Data: Compare the current data from the paper with historical data to recognize changes over time.
     - Future Predictions: Use current trends from the paper to make predictions about future developments.
     - Anomaly Detection: Look for unusual or unexpected values from the paper that deviate from general trends.
     - Hypothesis Formation: Formulate hypotheses about why certain trends from the paper occur, and consider how you might test them.

### Evaluation Steps:

1. **Answer the Questions Independently**:
   - Independently answer each of the original and revised questions.

2. **Compare Questions**:
   - Compare the original and revised versions of each question based on the following criteria:
     1. **Visual Attributes**: Does each question genuinely require examination of the visual attributes of the image?
     2. **Category Coverage**: Verify that the questions are from these categories:
        - "Simple Retrieval"
        - "Simple Calculation"
        - "Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning" (2)
        - "Additional Context Question".
     3. **Relevance and Fit**: Do the questions fit the provided figure and are they relevant?
     4. **Clarity and Unambiguity**: Are the questions clear and unambiguous, allowing for only one correct answer?
     5. **Answer-ability**: Can the questions be answered accurately using the image and metadata? Criticize questions that cannot.
     6. **Complexity Appropriateness**: Is the complexity level suitable for each question?
     7. **Context Integration**: Evaluate the effectiveness of context integration from the figure or accompanying text.
     8. **Language Precision**: Check for clarity, grammar, and phrasing.
     9. **Variety**: Ensure a variety of question types and difficulty levels.
     10. **Creativity**: Assess the originality and creativity of the questions (only relevant for questions with additional context).

3. **Select the Better Question**:
   - Based on the comparison, select the better version of each question (original or revised).
   - If both questions do not work for the figure (based on the evaluation criteria), create a question of your own.
   - Always choose a question that is answerable over a question that is not.

4. **Compare Answers**:
   - Compare the answers to each question based on the following criteria:
     1. **Accuracy**: Verify the correctness of each answer.
     2. **Clarity**: Ensure the answers are clearly stated and easy to understand.
     3. **Completeness**: Confirm that the answers provide all necessary information.
     4. **Conciseness**: Check for concise, to-the-point answers.
     5. **Confidence Level**: Indicate the confidence level in the correctness of each answer.

5. **Select the Better Answer**:
   - Based on the comparison, select the better version of each answer (original or revised).
   - If the answer to a question is incorrect compared to your own answer, correct it based on your answer.

6. **Final Submission**:
   - Provide both the selected questions and answers in English and German.
   - Please use this JSON schema:

### Example JSON Schema:

QAPair = {"question_german": str, "question_english": str, "answer_english": str, "answer_german": str}
Return: [QAPair1(Simple Retrival), QAPair2(Simple Calculation), QAPair3(Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning), QAPair4(Complex Calculation and Logical Reasoning), QAPair5(Additional Context Question)]

Here is an example of how the output looks like, it starts and ends with a square bracket:
"[
    {"question_german": "german question 1", "question_english": "english question 1", "answer_english": "english answer 1", "answer_german": "german answer 1"},
    {"question_german": "german question 2", "question_english": "english question 2", "answer_english": "english answer 2", "answer_german": "german answer 2"}
]"

ONLY reply with the JSON, nothing else! No additional text, just the JSON! Ensure the response is a valid JSON object!
The JSON string must be parsable directly form your response with no adjustment required. This is extremely important.
