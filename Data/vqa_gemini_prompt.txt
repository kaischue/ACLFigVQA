Create a question about this figure
It should be a visual question, meaning mention at least on visual attribute like color, position or orientation of the different plot elements.
You should only be able to answer it if you look at the image, not just with extracted data as a table.
But the question should not be too simple, at least high school level but preferable college level.
Also, please provide the question in English and German. And then answer the question.
Chose three random question templates as a base from the templates I provided to you. Not all templates fit all images.
So choose on that fits and fill in the variables. You can adjust the templates a bit, so it fits the image if necessary.
There could be cases possible where no templates fit for the image, in this case you should create a question of your own.
But still make sure the question still mentions at least on visual attribute and has at least medium complexity.
Additionally, you also got the frist 10000 characters of research paper available as text from where the image was sourced from.
At least on question should require additional context from the paper to be answered, but it should still be a visual question.
You don't have to follow a template for this advanced question.
Your questions do not have to match the template exactly.
You can use it as a base. Just reply with the questions in english and german. And the answers in english and german.

Please use this JSON schema:

QAPair = {"question_german": str, "question_english": str, "answer_english": str, "answer_german": str}
Return: [QAPair1, QAPair2, ...]

Here is an example of how the output looks like, it starts and ends with a square bracket:
"[
    {"question_german": "german question 1", "question_english": "english question 1", "answer_english": "english answer 1", "answer_german": "german answer 1"},
    {"question_german": "german question 2", "question_english": "english question 2", "answer_english": "english answer 2", "answer_german": "german answer 2"}
]"

ONLY reply with the JSON, nothing else! No additional text, just the JSON! Ensure the response is a valid JSON object!
The JSON string must be parsable directly form your response with no adjustment required. This is extremely important.
