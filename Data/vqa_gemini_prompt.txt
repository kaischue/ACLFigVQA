Create a question about this figure.
The question should be a visual question, mentioning at least one visual attribute like color, position, or orientation of the different plot elements.
It should only be answerable by examining the visual attributes of the image, not merely by converting it to a data table. This ensures that the question relies on visual details and can't be answered without the image.
Please provide the question in both English and German. Then, answer the question in both languages.
Using the provided question templates as a base, create one question from each of the following categories:
"Simple_Retrieval"
"Simple_Calculation_1-Step"
"Complex_Calculation_Multi-Step"
"Logical_Reasoning"

Choose the template that best fits the image and fill in the variables, adjusting the templates as needed to suit the image.
If none of the templates fit the image, create a question of your own, ensuring it mentions at least one visual attribute and has at least medium complexity.
Additionally, create one question that requires additional context from the paper, caption, or inline reference to be answered, but it should still be a visual question if possible. This question does not need to follow a template.

In total, there should be 5 questions:
One from "Simple_Retrieval"
One from "Simple_Calculation_1-Step"
One from "Complex_Calculation_Multi-Step"
One from "Logical_Reasoning"
One that requires additional context from the paper

Please provide both the questions and answers in English and German.
Please use this JSON schema:

QAPair = {"question_german": str, "question_english": str, "answer_english": str, "answer_german": str}
Return: [QAPair1, QAPair2, ...]

Here is an example of how the output looks like, it starts and ends with a square bracket:
"[
    {"question_german": "german question 1", "question_english": "english question 1", "answer_english": "english answer 1", "answer_german": "german answer 1"},
    {"question_german": "german question 2", "question_english": "english question 2", "answer_english": "english answer 2", "answer_german": "german answer 2"}
]"

ONLY reply with the JSON, nothing else! No additional text, just the JSON! Ensure the response is a valid JSON object!
The JSON string must be parsable directly form your response with no adjustment required. This is extremely important.
